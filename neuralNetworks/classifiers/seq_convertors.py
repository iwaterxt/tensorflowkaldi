'''@file seq_convertors.py
this file contains functions that convert sequential data to non-sequential data
and the other way around. Sequential data is defined to be data that is suetable
as RNN input. This means that the data is a list containing an N x F tensor for
each time step where N is the batch size and F is the input dimension non
sequential data is data suetable for input to fully connected layers. This means
that the data is a TxF tensor where T is the sum of all sequence lengths. This
functionality only works for q specified batch size'''
